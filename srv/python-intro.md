To start off the year,
we are teaching the basics of Python,
an easy and popular programming language
that we can use to create our projects later in the year.

These are all our lessons so far:

- [Lesson 1](lesson-1): Installing Python; introduction to primitive datatypes; strings; and variables
- [Lesson 2](lesson-2): Integers and floats; Python math; operators; booleans; and conditionals
