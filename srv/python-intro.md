To start off the year,
we are teaching the basics of Python,
an easy and popular programming language
that we can use to create our projects later on.

These are all our lessons so far:

1.  [Installation, Datatypes, and Variables](/meetings/2022/meeting-1/)
2.  [Math, Operators, and If Statements](/meetings/2022/meeting-2/)
    - [Activity for Python Lesson #2](/meetings/2022/meeting-2/activity/)
    - [Activity Solution for Python Lesson #2](/meetings/2022/meeting-2/activity-solution/)
