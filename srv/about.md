title: About Us

Welcome to *DT Code Club's website*!

Founded in early 2020,
we are a club at David Thompson Secondary School,
lead entirely by students who want to share
their *love and dedication* for programming and technology.
With more than sixty students annually,
we are one of the most popular and fastest-growing clubs at the school!

Club meetings are held each Thursday
in Mr. Noah's computer lab, room 308, starting at 11:40.
Generally, each meeting begins with a lesson 
explaining the fundamental concepts of the topic,
while students are free to create and explore on their own
for the rest of the lunch period
with their newly-learned skills,
guided by our friendly and talented volunteer execs
who are always available for help.

While lessons are fixed on teaching
the basics of a programming language
at the beginning of each year
to ensure that every club member
can grasp the basics of programming,
once everyone is able to transform their ideas into code,
the topics we explore afterwards
are suggested and decided by club members,
according to their own interest!

All skill levels are welcome,
and no coding knowledge or experience is required.
Passionate about coding, or just curious?
Don't hesitate to [join us](/join)!
