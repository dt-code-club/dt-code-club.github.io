title: About Us

Welcome to *DT Code Club's website*!

We are the David Thompson Code Club,
led entirely by students
who want to share their passion for programming and technology!
Since 2020,
we've been bringing students together
over a shared passion for technology,
and we are one of the largest and most popular clubs at the school
with more than sixty members annually!

## Meetings

Club meetings are held each Thursday
in Mr. Taylor's computer lab, room 305.
Our meetings start at 11:55;
please eat before you come,
as eating is not permitted at the computers!

Due to COVID-19 restrictions and a limited number of seats,
we may unfortunately have to turn away students
if too many people show up.
If you are turned away,
just let us know and
we can gladly reserve a seat for you the next week!

Generally, each meeting begins with a lesson 
explaining the fundamental concepts of the topic,
while students are free to create and explore on their own
for the rest of the lunch period
with their newly-learned skills,
guided by our friendly and talented volunteer execs
who are always available for help.

While lessons are fixed on teaching
the basics of a programming language
at the beginning of each year
to ensure that every club member
can grasp the basics of programming,
once everyone is able to transform their ideas into code,
the topics we explore afterwards
are suggested and decided by club members,
according to their own interests!
