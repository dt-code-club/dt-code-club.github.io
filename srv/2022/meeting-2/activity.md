Hello everyone!
This week we covered operators and if statements in Python.
Here's a simple activity
to see if you actually learned anything!

Create three variables: `num_1`, `num_2`, and `num_3`
and give them a number value (an integer or a float).

Find the **average** (mean value)
of the numbers in the three variables
and print that.

Then, check to see whether the average is **postive, negative, or zero**,
and accordingly print one of the following strings:
"The average is positive",
"The average is negative",
or "The average is zero".

That's all!

## Trials

Try testing your code with your initial variables
as the following values.

This should print "3.5" and "The average is positive":

```python
num_1 = -5
num_2 = 8
num_3 = 7.5
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

This should print "0.0" and "The average is zero":

```python
num_1 = 7
num_2 = -4.0
num_3 = -3
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

This should print "-1.0" and "The average is negative":

```python
num_1 = -7
num_2 = 1
num_3 = 3
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

The answers will be posted next Monday.

Good luck!
